Title: Uncovering Trends in Data using R and ggplot2

Instructions:
1. Set Up Your Environment: Start by ensuring that your R environment is properly set up. Install the necessary packages using `install.packages("package_name")` if they are not already installed. You will be primarily needing `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

2. Load the Dataset: The "USArrests" dataset is built into R. You can load it into your environment using `data("USArrests")`.

3. Understand the Data: Perform some initial exploration on the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and overall makeup. Use functions like `str()`, `summary()`, `head()`, and `names()` to get a sense of your data.

4. Preprocess the Data: This step involves preparing your data for analysis. Check for missing values with `is.na()` and decide how to handle them if there are any. Also, consider standardizing your data if needed to make it easier to work with.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover basic trends, patterns, and relationships in the data. This can involve looking at correlations between variables with `cor()`, or examining the distribution of variables.

6. Visualize the Data: Use the `ggplot2` package to create visualizations. Start with basic plots like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots. Then, move on to more complex visualizations like facet plots or grouped bar plots. Remember to label your axes and provide titles to your plots.

7. Interpret the Visualizations: Study the visualizations you've created and try to interpret them. Look for any noticeable trends or patterns. Remember, the goal here is to uncover insights from the data.

8. Document Your Findings: After interpreting your visualizations, document your findings. Write a report summarizing your process, the visualizations you created, and the trends or insights you've discovered. Be sure to provide enough detail so that others can understand your work.

Functions:
- Packages: ggplot2, dplyr
- Functions and methods: `read.csv()`, `summary()`, `str()`, `dim()`, `head()`, `tail()`, `names()`, `is.na()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `cor()`, `ggplot()`, `aes()`, `geompoint()`, `geomline()`, `geombar()`, `facetwrap()`, `theme()`, `xlab()`, `ylab()`, `ggtitle()`

Dataset: The "USArrests" dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.
